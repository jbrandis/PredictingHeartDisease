# PredictingHeartDisease
This repository is where my team and I worked on predicting if someone was likely to have heart disease or not

In this repository, there are 4 folders Data, Presentation, Article, and Notebooks.

The Data folder has the .csv files of the data we used in this project, as well as a cleaned up data file

The Presentation folder has our .pptx file of our graphs and slideshow presentation

The Project folder has my ipynb pandas file
To begin running this data, download the data and reference it correctly in a pandas environment

The Article folder has the article my team and I wrote about our study.

This repository shows different models of logistic regresssion, nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forest, and ensembling to predict if someone has heart disease or not.
